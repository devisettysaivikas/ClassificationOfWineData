This project was developed by Sai Vikas Devisetty as a part of CS 504 (Principles of Data Management and Mining) by Dr.Ping Deng of George Mason University.
There are 2 steps involved in this project
1.Data preprocessing
2.Applying Decision tree,Random Forest,KNN,Naive Bayes techniques for the classification of wines into different classes
